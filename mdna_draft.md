### 📄 MD&A Draft (REFERENCE OUTPUT)
### Financial Performance Overview

During the reporting period, the company experienced a significant decline in year-over-year revenue, indicating sustained pressure on long-term operating performance. Despite this contraction, the most recent quarter showed strong quarter-over-quarter revenue growth, suggesting a potential short-term recovery or seasonal improvement in business activity. Profitability remained challenged, with negative profit margins reflecting continued cost pressures and operating inefficiencies.

### Revenue Drivers

The sharp decline in annual revenue suggests weakening demand or reduced activity across core business segments over the past year. However, the strong quarter-over-quarter revenue increase may be driven by short-term factors such as timing of contracts, temporary demand recovery, or operational adjustments implemented during the period. While these recent improvements are encouraging, they have not yet offset the broader annual revenue decline.

### Risk Factors

The company faces ongoing financial risks related to declining annual revenue and sustained negative profit margins. Continued cost pressures and uncertainty around the durability of recent revenue improvements could adversely affect future performance. Failure to stabilize long-term revenue growth or improve cost efficiency may limit the company’s ability to achieve sustainable profitability.
